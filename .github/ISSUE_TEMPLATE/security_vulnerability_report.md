**⚠ IMPORTANT — Do NOT post full exploit details publicly.**  
If you discovered a vulnerability, first follow the project's `SECURITY.md`: send a private report to the security contact (email) listed there. If you cannot reach the contact by email, open this issue **without** including sensitive PoC/exploit code — provide a summary and contact information, and maintainers will follow up with a secure channel.
